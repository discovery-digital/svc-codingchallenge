# Coding Challenge
Our coding challenge is your opportunity to demonstrate your experience, skills and aptitude by building a single solution to the following challenge:
- [Streams API](https://github.com/discovery-digital/svc-codingchallenge/blob/master/streams_api.md)

## Submission Guidelines
Once you are ready to submit your solution, please ensure the following guidelines are followed:
- Although we recognize and appreciate knowledge in many languages, we ask that your solution be implemented in either PHP, Go or Python
- Link to the Github-hosted repository
- At least one main README describing the following:
  - Description of your problem and solution
  - Any special dependencies or system requirements needed to run your solution
  - Instructions on how to:
    - Build your solution
    - Run your solution
    - Run your unit tests
  - Any other sections you deem worthy of documenting in a similar fashion to a production service you would ordinarily develop

Note: You do not need to host your code anywhere. We will follow your README instructions for how to build and run your solution.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your code will be evaluated on the following criteria:
- **Code quality** - Is the code simple to understand and maintainable? Does the code raise any implementation concerns?
- **Correctness** - Does your solution do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why?
- **Thoroughness** - Attention to detail (i.e., edge cases considered)
- **Testing** - Not necessarily looking for full test coverage but trying to get a sense of your approach to testing your code 
- **Technical choices** - Do the choice of libraries, patterns, etc. seem appropriate?
